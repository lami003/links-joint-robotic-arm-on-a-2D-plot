#Task 2
This task involve using forward kinematics using a 2D ,3D ,4D link arm in python

#What I Did
 Cloned the GitHub repo to my VS code
Created my folder and copied the file
Renamed it to  Olamide-2_links_2d.py
Went through the code and added detailed comments and also modified it for the other links
Learned how the math behind the 2D arm works by going through the calculation

# Code Explanation Highlights
Explain the logic or key parts of the code.
Example:
1. The code uses trigonometry to calculate the (x, y) position of the 2-link arm.
2. It uses 30 degree angles and link lengths to simulate arm movement.
3. Functions like cosine and sine are used to calculate positions.

# What I Learned
1. I learned how forward kinematics works in robotics.
2. I got better at reading and commenting Python code.
3. I learned how to set up Python and VS Code and also how to import numpy and matplotlib
4. Added a plot using matplotlib to visualize arm movement.
5. Tested the code with different angles and lengths.
